## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<p align="center">I am an aspiring Junior Software Developer. My passion is creating apps and projects that I can be proud of, but my focus has mainly been on web development.</p>
<p align="center">I graduated with a B.Sc in Computer Science in 2024, and ever since then I have been diving deeper into various technologies and languages in an effort to expand my skillset and knowledge.</p>
