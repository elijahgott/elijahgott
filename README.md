## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<p align="left">I am Elijah, an aspiring junior software developer. My passion is in creating beautiful apps and websites, which is why my focus has mainly been on front-end web development. I have been learning more about backend development as well, in an effort to become a full-stack developer.</p>

<p align="left">I graduated with a B.Sc in Computer Science in 2024, and ever since then I have been diving deeper into various technologies and languages to expand my skill set and knowledge.</p>
